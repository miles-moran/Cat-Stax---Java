# Cat-Stax---Java

This program is designed to solve packing puzzles.

Users enter a container and shapes. The program will then, if possible, place all shapes snugly in their container.

The runtime of the solving function is brief with simple, 2d problems, but 3d problems can take up to 20 minutes. 

This program was inspired by a child's puzzle game known as Cat Stax, which you can find at your local Target.
